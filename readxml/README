Read W365 XML-output to a "base.DbTopLevel" structure. It covers only a subset
of the W365 elements and has certain particular expectations:

"Epoch" courses are not handled. Using special "Categories" starting with
"_" it is possible to represent blocks (SuperCourses and SubCourses).

"Lessons" should be specified using the "SplitHoursPerWeek" notation
(with "+").
